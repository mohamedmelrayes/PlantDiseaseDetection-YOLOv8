# PlantDiseaseDetection-YOLOv8
## Overview

Plant Disease Detection using YOLOv8 is a deep learning project aimed at detecting diseases on plants using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The project utilizes a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased plant leaves to train the model to accurately identify various types of plant diseases.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect diseases on plant leaves in images.
- **Disease Classification:** Classifies detected diseases into various categories for accurate diagnosis.
- **Google Colab Integration:** Utilizes Google Colab for model training, leveraging its cloud computing capabilities for efficient training on large datasets.
- **Customizable Training:** Allows for customization of training parameters and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model for specific requirements.
- **Easy Deployment:** Provides easy deployment options for integrating the trained model into real-world applications for automated plant disease diagnosis.
